		Residency programs for artists are fantastic opportunities that offer time, space, and sometimes funding for artists to focus on their work, engage with a community, or explore new ideas. Many of these programs are specifically designed to support the artistic process, whether you’re working in visual arts, writing, music, or other creative fields. They often provide a variety of resources, including studio space, accommodations, and access to professional networks.
